# Youtube Downloader
 
 This is a little python project I did a while back, all it does is download the youtube video at the link you provide.  
 **I wrote and ran it in pycharm, it may not work outside it. For me it didn't.**
 And yes, it's ugly but it works and that's what matters. I will try making it nicer, but I'm not an expert in CSS.

### Install dependencies
 ```
 pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 ```
### Usage
 After you run it you should see this:
 ```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 ```
 Just open the link in your browser. The rest is pretty simple. *Make sure you copy the **whole link** not just the id.*
 Don't worry if the page appears frozen, the download may take a long time, depending on the video length.
