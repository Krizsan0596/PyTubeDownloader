# Youtube Downloader
 
 This is a little project I did a while back, all it does is download the youtube video at the link you provide.
## I wrote and ran it in pycharm, it may not work outside it. For me it didn't.

### Install instructions
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/Krizsan0596/YoutubeDownloader.git
 cd YoutubeDownloader
 pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 ```
### Usage
 After you run it you should see this:
 ```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 ```
 Just open the link in your browser. The rest is pretty simple.
